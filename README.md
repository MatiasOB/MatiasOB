## Projects

- [Ames Housing App](https://matiasob-data-sci-streamlit-appsames-housingames-housing-zxwbn3.streamlit.app/) - I developed my first Streamlit app using the Ames housing dataset (Kaggle), which involves performing exploratory data analysis, providing feature descriptions, building a ETL pipeline to generate data ready to be fed in a ML model for inference to predict house prices, and finally deploying the app in streamlit cloud.

- [S&P500 stock Analysis app](https://matiasob-data-science-p-streamlit-appsstock-appstock-app-7cgvtn.streamlit.app/) - This App provides both basic and technical information about individual S&P500 Stocks.

- [Covid-19 Dashboard](https://matiasob-data-sc-streamlit-appsdashboard-examplecovid-19-4i3hf3.streamlit.app/) - This App proves a very basic dashboard to track covid-19 data from various countries.

I have several other projects, but the ones i'm showing here are deployed on Streamlit Cloud, which makes it easier to showcase them. Feel free to also check out my   ![Kaggle Account](https://www.kaggle.com/matiasob) or some of my public repositories in this github account.
