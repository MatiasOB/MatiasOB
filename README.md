# Hi there, I'm Matias ObaidðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a Mining Engineer and a Data Scientist with more than 1 year of experience in data analysis, statistical modeling and machine learning. I have a passion for solving complex problems and turning data into actionable insights. In my free time, I enjoy doing exercise, watching football, listening to podcasts, reading and learning new stuff in the fast moving but broad field of data science.

- Programming Languages: Python
- Data Analysis: Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Statsmodels, Sympy, SqlAlchemy
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Optuna
- Model Interpretability: Shap
- Model Deployment: Streamlit
- Other libraries: yfinance, yahooquery, PacMap, Darts and many, many more.
- Database Language: PostgreSQL
- Other Skills: Git, Jupyter Notebook, PowerBI, Primavera P6, Excel

## Projects

- [Ames Housing App](https://matiasob-data-sci-streamlit-appsames-housingames-housing-zxwbn3.streamlit.app/) - Streamlit app built around the Ames housing dataset ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)), This project involves several tasks, including performing exploratory data analysis, providing feature descriptions, building an ETL pipeline to generate data that can be fed into an ML model for inference to predict house prices, feature importances and deploying the app on Streamlit Cloud.

- [Quality Prediction in a Mining Process](https://www.kaggle.com/code/matiasob/dataset-is-corrupt-and-should-not-be-used) - In this notebook, I conducted an in-depth investigation to demonstrate that the dataset is corrupted due to a series of anomalies. To the best of my knowledge, I was the first to suggest this idea. The dataset is relatively unknown, with less than 50 Kaggle notebooks submitted on it. Moreover, it is the only publicly available dataset (that I know of) that pertains to the flotation process inside a Concentrate processing plant.

- [Food Vision App](https://matiasob-food-vision-food-vision-ewd0i6.streamlit.app/) - This Streamlit App is capable of classifying images into 10 different food classes and is built around the Food 101 dataset. Due to time and computational power constraints, the app uses only 10 classes instead of the original 101. The project involves implementing transfer learning and fine-tuning an EfficientNetV2B3 model in TensorFlow to achieve this task, as well as handling all the pipelines required to turn it into a functional app."

- [S&P500 stock Analysis app](https://matiasob-data-science-p-streamlit-appsstock-appstock-app-7cgvtn.streamlit.app/) - This App provides both basic and technical information about individual S&P500 Stocks.

- [Covid-19 Dashboard](https://matiasob-data-sc-streamlit-appsdashboard-examplecovid-19-4i3hf3.streamlit.app/) - This App provides a very basic dashboard to track covid-19 data from various countries.

I have several other projects, but most of the ones that i'm showing here are deployed on Streamlit Cloud, which makes it easier to showcase them. Feel free to also check out my [Kaggle Account](https://www.kaggle.com/matiasob) or some of the public repositories in my github.
