## Projects

- [Ames Housing App](https://matiasob-data-sci-streamlit-appsames-housingames-housing-zxwbn3.streamlit.app/) - I developed my first Streamlit app using the Ames housing dataset, which involved performing exploratory data analysis, provide variable descriptions, building and interpreting a predictive model, and deploying the app

- [S&P500 stock Analysis app](https://matiasob-data-science-p-streamlit-appsstock-appstock-app-7cgvtn.streamlit.app/) - This App provides both basic and technical information about individual S&P500 Stocks.

I have several other projects, but these ones are deployed on Streamlit Cloud, which makes it easier to showcase them.
