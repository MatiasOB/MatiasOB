# Hi there, I'm Matias ObaidðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a Mining Engineer and a Data Scientist with more than 1 year of experience in data analysis, statistical modeling and machine learning. I have a passion for solving complex problems and turning data into actionable insights. In my free time, I enjoy doing exercise, watching football, listening to podcasts, reading and learning new stuff in the fast moving but broad field of data science.

## Skills

- Programming Languages: Python
- Data Analysis: Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Statsmodels, Sympy, SqlAlchemy
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Optuna
- Model Interpretability: Shap
- Model Deployment: Streamlit
- Other libraries: yfinance, yahooquery, PacMap, Darts and many, many more.
- Database Language: PostgreSQL
- Other Skills: Git, Jupyter Notebook, PowerBI, Primavera P6, Excel

## Projects

- [Quality Prediction in a Mining Process](https://www.kaggle.com/code/matiasob/dataset-is-corrupt-and-should-not-be-used) - Here, I performed an in-depth analysis to demonstrate that this dataset is corrupted due to a series of anomalies (I'm the first one to suggest this idea). The dataset is fairly unknown; less than 50 people have submitted a notebook in Kaggle related to it. Additionally, it is the only publicly available dataset (that i know of) related to the flotation process inside an Iron Concentrate processing plant.

- [Ames Housing App](https://matiasob-data-sci-streamlit-appsames-housingames-housing-zxwbn3.streamlit.app/) - I developed my first Streamlit app using the Ames housing dataset ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)), which involves performing exploratory data analysis, providing feature descriptions, building a ETL pipeline to generate data ready to be fed in a ML model for inference to predict house prices, and finally deploying the app in streamlit cloud.

- [S&P500 stock Analysis app](https://matiasob-data-science-p-streamlit-appsstock-appstock-app-7cgvtn.streamlit.app/) - This App provides both basic and technical information about individual S&P500 Stocks.

- [Covid-19 Dashboard](https://matiasob-data-sc-streamlit-appsdashboard-examplecovid-19-4i3hf3.streamlit.app/) - This App provides a very basic dashboard to track covid-19 data from various countries.

I have several other projects, but the ones i'm showing here are deployed on Streamlit Cloud, which makes it easier to showcase them. Feel free to also check out my   [Kaggle Account](https://www.kaggle.com/matiasob) or some of the public repositories in my github.
